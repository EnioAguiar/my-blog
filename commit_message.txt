refactor: Remove multi-language support and unify to English-only

This commit removes the entire internationalization (i18n) system from the blog, converting it from a bilingual (PT/EN) site to a single-language (English) site.

Key changes:
-   Deleted all Portuguese content from `src/content/blog/pt`.
-   Moved all English content to the root `src/content/blog/` directory.
-   Removed all language-specific pages and routes (e.g., `/en`, `/pt`).
-   Simplified the i18n configuration (`src/i18n/ui.ts`) and all related components and layouts to work with a single language.
-   Updated the `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new, simplified project structure and conventions.
