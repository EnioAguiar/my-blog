So, Gavin Newsom is calling on Democrats to “meet fire with fire” in the redistricting war against Trump and the GOP. On the surface, I get it. There’s a certain catharsis in hearing a high-profile Democrat finally advocate for dropping the Marquess of Queensberry rules in a political knife fight.

For years, the Democratic playbook has felt like bringing a strongly worded letter to a gunfight. The sentiment from supporters is palpable: “Finally,” they say, “someone willing to play the same game.”

But let’s be brutally honest with ourselves. This isn’t a moment of strategic genius. It’s a moment of surrender.

It’s the quiet, depressing admission that the high road has been washed away in the flood. It’s the acceptance that the political arena is no longer a place for debate over ideas, but a zero-sum cage match where the only goal is to wound the opponent, even if it means breaking the system in the process. “Meeting fire with fire” isn’t a strategy; it’s an acknowledgment that the whole house is already burning.

When one party engages in aggressive gerrymandering and norm-breaking, the principled response is to fortify the institutions and appeal to a sense of fairness. The pragmatic—and cynical—response is to grab your own can of gasoline. The Democrats, it seems, are finally reaching for the gas.

What is the endgame here? A country where districts are so contorted and politically segregated that elections are decided years in advance by a handful of party insiders drawing lines on a map? A political landscape where the art of persuasion is replaced entirely by the brute force of legislative procedure?

This isn’t a sign of strength. It’s a symptom of a deep, systemic sickness. It’s a concession that the game is so rigged that the only way to win is to rig it better than the other side. It’s a race to the bottom, and the prize for winning is presiding over the ashes.

So, no, I don’t feel a surge of hope hearing this new rhetoric. I feel a profound sense of disgust. It’s the disgust of watching the supposed adults in the room finally decide that the only way to deal with the playground bully is to become a bully themselves. It might work in the short term, but the playground is left in ruins.
