The promise of cryptocurrency was always about financial sovereignty—the radical idea that you, and only you, should control your assets. This week, the Brazilian state delivered a powerful counter-punch to that idea.

Meet **CriptoJud**, a new system launched by Brazil's National Council of Justice (CNJ) that functions as a "SisbaJud for crypto." For those unfamiliar, SisbaJud is the tool the judiciary uses to freeze funds directly from bank accounts. CriptoJud extends this power to cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.

Ostensibly, the tool is an "upgrade." Minister Luís Roberto Barroso, president of the CNJ, framed it as a move toward efficiency. Instead of sending slow, manual requests to individual exchanges to see if a debtor holds assets, judges can now, with the click of a button, query and block Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies across all participating platforms simultaneously.

But let's call this what it is: a centralized dragnet for decentralized assets.

### The Iron Fist in a Velvet Glove

This isn't just about making debt collection more efficient. It's about the state extending its control over a technology that was designed to exist beyond its grasp. For years, assets held on exchanges have been a gray area. CriptoJud removes all ambiguity. If your crypto is on a Brazilian exchange, it is now as vulnerable to seizure as the money in your bank account.

The core principle of **"not your keys, not your coins"** has never been more relevant. By leaving your assets on an exchange, you are entrusting them to a third party. CriptoJud simply formalizes the state's ability to compel that third party to hand them over.

In a moment of peak irony during the launch event, Minister Barroso reportedly joked that he'd consider buying some crypto himself once he fully understood it. The same official launching a system for mass seizure is casually contemplating becoming an investor, seemingly oblivious to the fundamental values his new tool undermines.

### This Is Your Final Warning

For crypto holders in Brazil, this is not a drill. This is the final, unambiguous warning. The convenience of using a centralized exchange now comes with the explicit risk of instantaneous, automated seizure by the state.

The only antidote is sovereignty. The only defense is **self-custody**.

If you've been putting off learning how to use a hardware wallet, the time is now. If you've been treating your exchange account like a savings account, you are playing a dangerous game. CriptoJud is a clear statement of intent from the government: they see your assets, and if they can reach them, they will.

Act accordingly.
