description: "A data breach at Columbia University exposed the data of 870,000 people. But the real story isn't the hackâ€”it's that we're no longer surprised. This is a symptom of a much larger disease."

Here we go again.

A headline breaks that feels like a rerun of a show we've all seen too many times: a major institution suffers a massive data breach. This time, the spotlight is on **Columbia University**, which exposed the personal data of **870,000 people**. The leaked information is the usual cocktail of digital vulnerability: academic records, financial details, and even health information.

Let's be honest, the initial shock we used to feel with these announcements is gone. It's been replaced by a grim sense of inevitability. We've become numb to the sheer scale of these failures. 870,000 individuals, each with their own life and privacy, are now just a number in a news report.

The real story here isn't just about a sophisticated hacker or a clever exploit. It's about the systemic failure of institutions we are taught to trust. A university like Columbia, with its immense resources and prestige, should be a fortress of data security. Instead, it's just another example of an organization that failed to protect the very people it serves.

This isn't just a technical problem; it's a cultural one. We hand over our most sensitive information with the implicit understanding that it will be safeguarded. Yet, time and time again, we see that this trust is misplaced. These breaches are no longer isolated incidents; they are a predictable outcome of a system that prioritizes data collection over data protection.

The Columbia University breach is a harsh reminder that our digital lives are incredibly fragile. It forces us to question who we can trust and serves as a wake-up call that we, as individuals, are the last line of defense for our own privacy. Because, clearly, the institutions holding our data aren't up to the task.
