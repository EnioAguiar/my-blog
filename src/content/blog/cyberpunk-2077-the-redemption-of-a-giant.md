The launch of Cyberpunk 2077 in December 2020 was, to say the least, a disaster. After years of intense hype, ambitious promises, and a massive marketing campaign, what players received was a game riddled with bugs, performance issues, especially on last-gen consoles, and an experience that fell far short of the expectations created. CD Projekt Red, a studio acclaimed for The Witcher 3, saw its reputation tarnished, its stock plummet, and fan trust shaken.

Social media was flooded with videos of hilarious and frustrating glitches, from flying cars to characters phasing through walls. Sony even removed the game from the PlayStation Store, an unprecedented move for a AAA title. The gaming community was in an uproar, divided between disappointment and anger. It seemed Cyberpunk 2077 was doomed to be an eternal example of how not to launch a game.

However, the story of Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't end there. In the years following its release, CD Projekt Red embarked on a remarkable redemption journey. Instead of abandoning the project, the studio committed to fixing the game. Numerous patches and updates were released, fixing bugs, improving performance, and adding features that should have been present from the start.

The 1.5 update, released in February 2022, was a significant milestone, bringing substantial improvements to next-gen and PC versions, as well as additional content. But it was with the `Phantom Liberty` expansion and the 2.0 update, released in September 2023, that Cyberpunk 2077 truly shined. `Phantom Liberty` added a new area, captivating characters, and an engaging storyline, while the 2.0 update completely revamped systems like combat, enemy AI, and the skill tree, transforming the gameplay experience.

Today, Cyberpunk 2077 is a completely different game from what it was at launch. Night City, once chaotic due to its bugs, is now an immersive and vibrant world, full of details and opportunities. Performance is solid, bugs are rare, and the story, which was always a strong point, can be fully appreciated. The game has not only regained the trust of many players but has also attracted new fans who would never have touched it in its original state.

Cyberpunk 2077's redemption serves as a powerful reminder that even the most disastrous launches can be turned around with dedication, hard work, and a genuine commitment to the community. CD Projekt Red learned a valuable lesson and, in the end, delivered the experience many had hoped for from the beginning. It's a success story that demonstrates the importance of persistence and actively listening to players.
