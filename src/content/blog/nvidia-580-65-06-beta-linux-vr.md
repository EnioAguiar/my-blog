NVIDIA has just released version 580.65.06 of its beta drivers for Linux users, bringing notable improvements, especially for Wayland environments and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.

Among the main new features, support for the Wayland `fifo-v1` protocol for Vulkan stands out, promising a smoother and more responsive experience in Wayland sessions. In addition, display latency optimizations and a significant reduction in VR application crashes have been implemented, which is excellent news for enthusiasts and developers.

This update also fixes several bugs, including crashes in GTK4 applications and display issues with HDMI connections. These fixes contribute to greater driver stability and reliability.

For Linux users who rely on NVIDIA graphics cards, this beta represents an important step towards more robust and optimized support for the latest technologies.
