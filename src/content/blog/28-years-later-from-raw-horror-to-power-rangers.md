I had high hopes for *28 Years Later*. The legacy of its predecessors is built on raw, visceral horror and the terrifying exploration of human nature under extreme pressure. The film even starts with a spark of that old promise. We're introduced to a group of children, with a focus on a boy named Jimmy, giving us an intriguing glimpse into a new generation of survivors.

But then, just as you're getting invested, the film abruptly cuts away.

We're thrown into a completely different story with a father and his son. And let's be blunt: the son has all the charisma of a wet cardboard box. The plot driving them—a clichéd quest to get their mother to a doctor on the mainland—feels uninspired and lazy. The palpable tension of the first two films is gone, replaced by a predictable journey with a character I couldn't care less about.

Just when I thought it couldn't get any stranger, the finale happens. Jimmy, the boy from the beginning, reappears as an adult, but he's not alone. He's leading a team of people dressed in colorful gear, performing acrobatic, almost choreographed, moves to dispatch the infected. It felt less like a desperate fight for survival and more like watching a Power Rangers squad. The gritty, terrifying realism that defined the series was replaced by something utterly ridiculous.

This movie is a massive letdown. The first two films understood that the real horror wasn't just the infected, but the dark places humanity goes when pushed to the brink. *28 Years Later* trades that psychological depth for cheap clichés and a bizarre, tone-deaf ending. It's a sequel that fundamentally misunderstands its own legacy.
