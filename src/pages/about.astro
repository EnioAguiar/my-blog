	<p>
		Hello, and welcome. This blog is, first and foremost, a personal space for me to explore my passions and share what I learn along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		I write from Brazil, driven by a deep fascination with technology and the dream of building a life on the internet. My main passion lies in the world of open sourceâ€”I believe in its philosophy of collaboration, community, and freedom. You'll notice that much of my interest revolves around the Linux universe, a place where I feel a constant sense of discovery and autonomy. This blog is part of my journey to turn that passion into a sustainable career.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, what can you expect to find here? Think of this site as a diary of my personal curiosity. The content will be a direct reflection of what has captured my interest at the moment. One day it might be a technical dive into a subject, the next a reflection on new software, or simply my thoughts on the state of technology. It's a journey without a fixed map, and I invite you to join me.
